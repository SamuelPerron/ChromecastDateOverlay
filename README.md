# Chromecast Date Overlay

This script will take every photos from a Google Photos album, print the current date on it and uploads it to a new album.

I use it to always display the current date on my TV that is connected to a Chromecast and "screensaves" with a Google Photos album.

I set to run every day at midnight so the date is updated.
(You have to create the cron on your system for it)
